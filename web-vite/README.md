# ðŸ¦Œ DeerFlow Web UI (Vite + React + TypeScript)

> Originated from Open Source, give back to Open Source.

This is the Vite + React + TypeScript web UI for [`DeerFlow`](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [`DeerFlow`](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow)
- Node.js (v22.14.0+)
- pnpm (v10.6.2+) as package manager

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL`: The URL of the deer-flow API.

It's always a good idea to start with the given example file, and edit the `.env` file with your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## How to Install

DeerFlow Web UI uses `pnpm` as its package manager.
To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
cd web-vite
pnpm install
```

## How to Run in Development Mode

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the Python API service is running before starting the web UI.

Start the web UI development server:

```bash
cd web-vite
pnpm dev
```

By default, the web UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

You can set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable if you're using a different host or location.

```ini
# .env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Build for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
